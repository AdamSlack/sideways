#Square Matrices Compass

#Instructions

## Components on Screen
[] Roundabout cards
[] Grid 4 x 4
[] Direction markers


# Details:

The black arm of the compass card indicates a direction of travel.

You must drag and position these cards on the grid, so that
each of the vehicles on these cards goes in the direction indicated on the compass cards. 

There are more cards than available spaces, so some of the cards will not fit in.



#Time Limit

Score is only counted within the 5 minutes.
