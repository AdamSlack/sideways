“You will see that there are groups of dots arranged in rows. Some of the
groups have 3 dots, some 4 and some 5 dots (indicate examples on the
practice row). I want you to cross out every group of 4 dots.”
“I want you to complete the first row as a practice.”
If the client is unsure what to do, cross out the first set of 4 dots as an
example and then ask the client to continue with the practice row. Check
the practice row. If the client makes any errors point them out, by saying
for example “you have missed a set of 4 dots here” or “you have crossed
out a group of 3 dots but the task is to cross out all the groups of 4 dots”.
Then say
“The task is timed but it is more important to be accurate than fast. Start
when you are ready”.
Start the stopwatch as soon as the client starts to attempt the task. If the
client seems to have forgotten the instructions or requests a repetition,
the instructions can be repeated once using the same wording as given at
the beginning of the task. After that no further explanation should be
given.
